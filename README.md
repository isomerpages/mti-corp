# This is an Isomer Next website

Isomer is a website builder for the Singapore Government, and this is one of the many websites that uses Isomer to deliver content to the members of public. This site is powered by Isomer Next, which is a template rendering engine written using Next.js.

Traditionally, in order to edit a website, one had to write in pure HTML. This is challenging for website administrators who had limited experience with HTML as it is not immediately readable or intuitive to non-experienced users.

Hence, Isomer Next uses [a set of components](https://github.com/isomerpages/isomer-components) that is framework-agnostic and allows website administrators to easily use to create websites of gold standards. Isomer Next uses block-based editing, as opposed to Markdown, as it is more intuitive to the site editors. Block-based editing also allows us to implement constraints on the component properties, nudging site editors to develop their site in a way that is easily understood and accessible to the members of public.
